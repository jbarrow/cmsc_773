      "[Hello fellow atheists (and even non-atheists!)., I just want to take a moment to share a story from today.    , Some background: I'm currently in a 4 year relationship with my lovely girlfriend., I was raised Roman Catholic but eventually became an atheist after my own personal struggles with religion., My girlfriend was raised Baptist, but I can tell that being with me and growing up has turned her closer to being some form of a Deist.    , We don't normally talk about religion., It has never been a problem between us two so the discussion rarely comes up., As a result, I don't believe she ever takes the time to think about it herself., Today, it did come up., Seeing as it had been so long since we last discussed it, I just asked her simple questions on what she believes or not.    , I could tell she was hesitant about answering certain questions, but her beliefs boiled down to her believing in a God that plays a role in our lives., She acknowledged that the Bible has many issues, but gave me a simple \"I don't know\" when I asked her thoughts about Jesus and what the afterlife is like (other than that she believes in one)., With this, I was happy., I didn't want to push my thoughts onto her.    , She also asked me some questions and made a comment that made me pretty sad., She told me that it made her sad that I was an atheist., It's funny how you can disagree about many other things (such as whether God intervenes in our lives or not) and still be happy with the person., If you disagree on whether or not God exists though, they instantly have a negative reaction and feel sad.    , She asked me questions such as \"How did we get here?\" and whatnot., When I replied with the Big Bang Theory, one of her comments was \", But that's just a theory!\", ., Her response really took me by surprise, because she is getting a degree in Human Biology and knows plenty about scientific theories, but gave such a silly response., After I started explaining the difference between a theory and a scientific theory, she quickly cut me off and admitted her mistake.    , Our discussion ended quickly after that, but what happened after a moment of silence gave me great hope., She started to get tears in her eyes, so I immediately thought I said something that offended her (haha)., She started explaining to me that she is just really confused about everything because she never thinks about it too much., She mentioned that if she did, she knew that there was a good chance that she would stop believing like me., The reason why she doesn't though is because she just has a hard time letting go., She had a good experience with her church community so it's hard to let go of all of that., I also think that there are some deeper thoughts (such as no afterlife) that would be very hard for her to accept., She also mentioned that she noticed she had knee-jerk reactions such as the \"It's just a theory!\" because it was instinct for her to defend what she was raised to believe., I didn't want to push the discussion any further (no man likes a girl in sad tears), so I decided to move on to something else.    , From all of this, I can tell that the wheels in her mind are starting to turn., She is on the right path, she just needs to make the journey., I don't really care what she ends up believing (to an extent), but I'm glad that she is starting to think *for herself*., That's the end., Nothing too magical, but I just wanted to share my experience from today., Thank you for reading.    , **TL;DR Girlfriend and I have a religious discussion., I realize that the wheels are starting to turn in her mind and that she is starting to think for herself., **]\n",

(substituting grades for dollars - something closer to home and more readily understood by all).After the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B. The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy., As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little.., The second test average was a D!, No one was happy., When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F. As the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else., To their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the reward away, no one will try or want to succeed., It could not be any simpler than that., Remember, there IS a test coming up., The 2012 elections., These are possibly the 5 best sentences you'll ever read and all applicable to this experiment:1., You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.2., What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.3., The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.4., You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it!5., When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.    , **TL;DR, What are your thoughts on this story that I'm sure you've read before?, **]\n",

      "[This game is awesome, after finally giving up on MMOs awhile back, this game has completely changed my mind., Playing this game on ultra with a 40 inch monitor from my couch..., The world really does feel amazing/alive/looks gorgeous!, Every minute detail!, These quests are TRULY FUN!?!?, (AND like come on, I get to play my heavy armored, sword and board tanking/two hander dpsing, conjuring, electricity eccentric, BATTLE MAGE, just like in my other ES games), Only official gripe is the bugged quests, but several relogs got around any one them for me., Also I'm confident they will be fixed., THAT SAID, I did hate how easy some missions/bosses were because of the sheer number of people in the first \"wave\"., But after I took a break from 6pm-11pm (actually stopped playing to hang out with a girl haha., That's either launch day blasphemy or a made up non sense right?)

Suprised?, OF COURSE NOT!, SO just LISTEN to the grand voice acting like a good audio book/narration, and really REALLY immerse yourself!, (I believe this could be tweaked so as i did not FEEL obligated to do this., EXAMPLE: add options/toggles to only see the quest dialogue as it's spoken (think karaoke text :P), and another option to hide answers/choices until you click or the NPC finishes talking, . ALSO, though much harder to implement I sure, NPCs really NEED better lip movement to match dialogue, and way more facial expression... if any lol?)Some of the quest areas are huge/gorgeous/expanses for a mere 1 or 2 quests!, And I still felt obligated to explore them, to typically be rewarded with a chest/node/whateever!, THIS THIS!ONCE MORE..., This game is beautiful!, The only MMO I've felt entitled to play from my couch with my 40 inch monitor &amp; surround sound (AUDIO is amazing as well!, Get several players to /drum waiting for a spawn..., WAR DRUMS MUCH?!), This setup is usually reserved for my pretty/stuck up single player adventures, not an MMO!?, MMOS are typically games where I don't want to sacrifice my mouse pad for an armrest/couch cushion, or sacrifice the edge a smaller screen has by reducing the amount of time I spend looking from left to right for information during PVP.

WAY WAY WAY more armor/weapons/styles than any vanilla ES game / most MMOS. NPCS thanking you for past exploits is flattering as well ;), .SERIOUSLY, ... I LOVE THIS GAME., The only true true con for me thus far is the sheer amount of time I know I'm going to sink into this game..., No regrets!

      "[First of all move over to the most secure (and luckily largest) darknet marketplace, Agora Market., The Agora Marketplace is invitation only which you can register for with this invite code/URL (you must use TOR browser to connect):http://agorahooawayyfoe.onion/register/rc0sgEuoCFBTC/Bitcoin Cleaning/Laundering (Cover Your Money Trail)This is IMHO one of the easiest ways to get caught., Money laundering is simply trying to make your profit look like it came from a legit source., Take IRL drug dealing for example., Lets say that the dealer wants to bank his profit instead of keeping the cash around his home., You cant just bank a large amount of money without being prepared to explain where it came from., Large amounts that are deposited all at once or quite often are flagged and LE can get involved., This is because the bank knows how often you deposit money and a large deposit of money can be seen as suspicious., Even small amounts every so often can be seen as suspicious as the bank will not know how the money is obtained and will assume it is from criminal activity most of the time., Now the dealer is faced with the problem of keeping the cash around his house which could be used as evidence if he was ever caught or he has to try and find a way to make it look like he obtained the money from a legit source., Getting back to the DNM's the same thing applies., Vendors have to make it look like the money came from a legitimate source., They can do this in a number of ways which I will not delve into but the ultimate goal is to make it seem that you obtained the money legally., The bank are aware of what bitcoin is and you have to be careful in the way to cash out your profit., Never transfer straight to/from a market and a service like coinbase that's tied to your real name., If you don't have a good idea of this read up more but the simplest way is to purchase or sell bitcoin on a place like localbitcoins.com (of course don't use your real name on an account) and use either western union with no ID (secret question/answer instead) or cash deposits into the BTC seller's bank account., Furthermore you should always use a tumbler as the first stop of your coin between the market (withdraw and deposit) and your legit wallet., These tumblers pool all the coin from thousands of users into various wallets and send you coin back from a different wallet, , this makes it so the coins cannot be traced via a look at the blockchain., Telling Somebody/Keep, Your Mouth ShutAnother big way vendors get caught., They could tell somebody who they think they can trust and the next thing they know they are busted because they opened their mouth., One of the beauties of the DNM's is it allows vendors to stay anonymous., IRL dealers suffer from the fact that if they cut someone off or they upset a customer it is easy for them to anonymously tip LE and get the dealer busted., Same thing applies to anyone who knows you are an online vendor., LE will address the claim that is made and it will be easy to catch you off guard., Never tell anyone of your online activities involving the DNM's IMHO this also applies if you are just a customer., The only person you can always trust us yourself and telling someone is one of the easiest ways to get caught., As you probably know when you first find out about being able to get any drug you want delivered in a day or two to your door (even super rare stuff or stuff at good prices) its AWESOME!, Some of your retard friends will think so too and they'll tell their retard friends and soon you'll be known as that guy who has the hookup coming from out of state/country which is something the police like to hear about., It was once said: Welcome to the dope game, this is where we don't play, leave your friends with no brains..., Real information linked to youYou would be surprised how many vendors accidentally link their DNM activity to themselves., It can be done in a number of ways., Take the recent busts for example and how the owner of SR2 used his real email address on the hosting company for his site., Stupid., Never use any real information that can link your DNM activity to you., Use both a fake name and return address when sending out packages., Lets say you use a fake address but your real name., The chances are the fake address is close by but how hard would it be for LE to find you with your real name if you use an address in your local area?, Not very hard., Never link anything to your real identity., EVER.Evidence in your homeEven if you do everything you can to avoid possible detection but LE somehow find out you are a vendor., Chances are they have absolutely nothing until they find solid evidence in your home., It is a very stupid mistake to make to keep all of your vending equipment/drugs in a place where they are easily found., Always keep them well hidden and make sure you do this every time you have finished getting everything ready for shipping., Find a very concealed way to hide everything including the packages ready to be sent when you are done., Never leave anything out in your home that could link you to your online vending activities., Post officeThis normally happens with poor stealth., If you are a regular you are bound to build a relationship with your post office but they would not think twice about dobbing you in., Let's say the package smells obvious to begin with., If it makes it to the postal system and gets caught then they have the return address your gave them to work from but if it gets caught at the post office they can easily call the police and identify that you gave them the package with CCTV., This is why a lot of people choose to use the post boxes but this is not always an option and is also not always guaranteed to maintain your anonymity.. Always make sure your stealth is 100% perfect., FingerprintsSomething that is easy to forget., IMHO you should always wear gloves while dealing with any package., If they fail to catch you out on anything else they will be able to identify your finger prints were on the package., Take precautions to keep your fingerprints off the package., Evidence on computerThey can easily catch you out with unencrypted evidence on your computer., PGP keys, Bitcoin wallets and TOR to name a few., None of these are illegal to have on your machine but can easily link you to your vendor activities if LE are trying to do so., Strong encryption and TAILS can really help out here., Always keep incriminating evidence on your machine to an absolute minimum., If you are vending then 100% of the time, as in always, access markets, wallets, etc., through a bootable TAILS install on a USB stick., This way nothing is saved to look at and you can easily dispose of your USB stick if need be leaving no traces of ever even using TOR let alone a darknet market at all., Market SeizuresWhen markets are seized it could compromise a vendor in a number of ways., Always remember strong PGP encryption and never disclose anything personal on a message., When a market is seized LE will go through all the information they can hoping to find something that can lead them to a possible vendor., If you have a pending order out there and your message is in plain text then voila, they just read your address and know who you are and what drugs you're buying/selling as well as when you're expecting a delivery., Sending ALL personal info and especially addresses encrypted with PGP is a must every time, its easy and will take you literally 15 extra seconds each time after you figure it out the first time., This is the difference between allowing the police to know your name and address alone with an incriminating record of the drugs you have bought/sold and them viewing a worthless block of garbled letters., I hope this can at least help a few of you out there by showing just how easy it is to make a simple mistake which could lead to LE involvement., Always use your common sense., Remember this is your freedom we're talking about, its illegal to be doing drug deals, especially through a federal service (USPS) across state and national borders., You'll feel real stupid sitting in Federal prison for years because you were too lazy to follow these simple and painless OPSEC/Operational security measures when you're buying or selling drugs on darknet markets or deepweb sites such as Agora!]\n",

      "[So in The Escapist article \"Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming\", editor-in-chief Greg Tito made a very important point regarding a particular Escapist article regarding Zoe Quinn and Wizardchan, and I think this deserves more attention then I have seen it get., The quote is as follows:&gt;But to explain is not to excuse., Our editor-in-chief, Greg Tito, having reviewed the facts at hand, concluded we ourselves have been imperfect in maintaining journalistic standards., A particularly problematic article, the one which generated his review, was about the alleged harassment of an indie developer by a forum community which denied the allegations but was itself victimized as a result of them., The article failed to cite the harassment as alleged, failed to give the forum community an opportunity present its point of view, and did not verify the claims or secure other sources., Mr. Tito has personally updated the article and spoken to all our editors about the importance of adhering to standards that will prevent such bad incidents from happening again., We, as a team, apologize for this error, both to our readers and to the forum community that suffered as a result., I, personally, apologize for this error, as well., To me this highlights what is a large part of the failings of a lot of articles that report on the harassment of women in gaming (or anyone in gaming.), There is no investigation, no fact-checking or verification, no *journalism.*Harassment is never qualified as \"alleged\", the people who allegedly performed said harassment (or the communities they are said to have come from), are never asked to comment, and often if they deny it, it is not even stated that they did so., There is a level of presumption in the reporting of these incidents that the claims of a harassed person must be true., There are a number of factors that play into this perception, most commonly:, * Harassment on the internet in general is a commonly accepted occurrence, mostly identified as trolling., *, It can be uncomfortable to show scepticism towards an alleged victim for the worry of making them feel shittier for having to prove the received the abuse., * People who have already taken a harassment victim at their word tend to be very hostile towards anyone who shows scepticism, condemning them for victim-blaming, or calling them crazy or a conspiracy-theorist., * In cases where a person who belongs to a typically victimized or oppressed group (be it gender, sexuality, race etc.), is the one being harassed, sceptics are also often condemned as sexist/racist/homophobic/etc., *, If you happen to be the friend of a person harassed, or in some way financially tied to them or even just a fan of their work, you are more inclined to take them at their word than someone who is a stranger to you., But there is a reason why, for example, when the news reports on someone arrested for a crime they are referenced as \"allegedly\" committing it., Even in the face of overwhelming evidence against the accused, you don't refer to them as a criminal until a verdict is given., Of course this doesn't always happen, but it should be decried when it doesn't., Since a lot of the focus is on Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn, let's specifically address articles that report on the harassment against them in particular., These articles typically always assume that:*, The harassment actually occurred;, *, The reason for the harassment is that they are women in gaming;*, Therefore, the people committing the harassment are doing so because they are misogynistic and deserve to be shamed for it., These articles typically never do any of the following:* Refer to the harassment as alleged or in any way explain that they do not know for certain that the harassment actually took place;* Verify the contents of screenshots or other proof provided by the victims;* Reach out for a statement from those accused of doing the harassing, where the alleged harassers are not anonymous or on throw-away accounts;*, Discuss any other possibilities for why harassment might occur: e.g. political views, ideologies, how they are presenting their message, etc., This is harmful because it can create an exaggerated or even entirely false narrative about the state of the gaming community and how it treats various prominent figures within it., The fact that harassment occurs online, both within gaming culture and just in general, is not up for debate, but the reasons why and how to best deal with it as a result, very much are., If you report inaccurately on these issues and then come to your own conclusions as to why the harassment occurs and what to do about it, without making it very clear to the reader that you are speaking opinion and not fact, you can create a very hostile environment., You can marginalize very large and diverse groups of people and before you know it, the discussion isn't even about the issues you talked about any more, but the way in which you talked about them., To give as much benefit-of-the-doubt to the people who are not reporting impartially or correctly on these issues I will assume that they genuinely just want harassment to stop and believe they are doing the right thing by posting these aggressive articles that seek to shame and denounce anyone who would harass other people online., But they're not doing the right thing, and I think this needs to be as big a part of the gamergate message as the issues about friendship or financial partronage between devs and press is., If anything, this is almost more important., P.S.For those interested, article quoted at the top is from here, on page 4:http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-,

      "[So I've been seeing this floating around my twitter feed and twitter is an annoying place to try and make a detailed point, so I figured I would just post something here mainly to get this off my chest., I have seen a small rumbling in my twitter feed, mostly from user HighlandArrow, that gamergate is somehow being hypocritical for supporting and promoting the BasedGamer project by Jennie Bharaj., For context, if anyone doesn't know, Jennie Bharaj is setting up a website by the name of BasedGamer intending to be a consumer-based review aggregator, similar to how rottentomatoes.com works for movies., The criticisms of gamergate promoting this website seem to be:**1) Creating \"that which we hate\" in creating a review aggregation website.2) Hypocrisy in making fun of people's use of patreon whilst supporting the indiegogo campaign for BasedGamer3) Hypocrisy around the idea of promotion of friends' projects4) Hypocrisy about the idea of nepotism**So let's take this step by step.**1), Creating \"that which we hate.\"**It is a mistake to assume that gamergate is inherently against game reviews, or game review aggregation in general., Many in gamergate are critical of metacritic and its influence in the gaming industry, but this is not to say that review aggregation as a concept is flawed., Metacritic is an exclusive club, and while I don't know the exact specifics of who's reviews get counted by its system, needless to say you have to be some level of professional for your game score to get counted into their average., More importantly, their use a weighted average, which means that some reviewers' scores are considered more important than others., We have no knowledge on exactly how this is decided, nor do we have any sway over who is or isn't considered important, as consumers., This means that when certain websites choose to give a game a lower score because of some personal belief, such as the game being sexist, it can have a real effect on the metacritic score (depending on which website or reviewer it was) and therefore determine whether the game is considered a success or not., Metacritic has undue influence on the industry because a lot of large game studios measure their success, in part, by their metacritic score, so gaming review scores by professional reviewers employed by gaming websites have a tangible effect on the people making the games., Creating a consumer review aggregator allows an alternative place for gamers to judge a games quality., This score is not based off of the opinions of a small elite, but off of the mass consensus of many different gamers with a wide variety of view points., If you only care about score, you can be reasonably confident that the average score actually represents an average of what most people think, rather than a handful of journalists none of whom you might agree with., If you want to actually read the content of the reviews themselves, whatever your personal and political beliefs are chances are you can find someone who shares those views and therefore can provide a meaningful review to you about the things you think are important in reviewing a game., In short, it is false equivalence to equate criticism of metacritic as a criticism of review aggregation in general, and the creation of a new and completely different kind of aggregator is in no way contributing to the problem.**2) Hypocrisy in making fun of people's use of Patreon whilst supporting the indiegogo campaign for BasedGamer**There has been quite a lot of joking around about Patreon, mostly when a pro-gamergate supporters receives some kind of abuse there are jokes about \"time to set up a Patreon.\"This is not a condemnation of Patreon itself, nor is it a condemnation of crowdfunding in general., It is only, specifically, a criticism of using Patreon in a specific way., Promoting yourself through telling stories of bad things that happen to you, especially when this leads to news articles about you, and then shortly thereafter reminding people that you have a patreon they can donate to., Jennie Bharaj is in no way promoting herself through victimhood, she is known in gamergate for being an outspoken supporter and advocate for gamers in the face of media lies and propaganda., Moreover, she is not asking money simple for existing, but for a legitimate project with clearly define goals., To say that you can never contribute to any legitimate crowdfunding project, because you once made fun of someone using the same system to get money from sympathy, is creating somewhat of a false dichotomy of the idea that you're either 100% against crowdfunding, or you endorse every possible use of it.**3) Hypocrisy about the idea of promoting a friends, project.**The simplest thing I can say here is that promoting a project made by a prominent member of a community is not the same as promoting a friends project., Namely because we're not promoting it JUST BECAUSE she is Jennie Bharaj, but because we actually support the idea., Also, gamergates problem with promoting a friend's project is, again, not with the basic concept of promoting a friend, but the specific context of a journalist or reviewer, who's job it is to inform their readers of interesting games or projects, telling us we should support or buy a product *because they are friends with the developer* and *without disclosing that information., *, If a journalist was to review a friends game, and make it clear they were friends, gamergate would have no problem with that., Gamergate members are neither journalists (for the most part) nor are they reviewing this website in any kind of professional manner, and even if they were, any personal connection (even just as a fan of Jennie) is clearly disclosed just by the nature of their support of gamergate, of which Jennie is a big contributor.**4) Hypocrisy around the ideas of nepotism**So a brief definition of exactly what nepotism is:&gt;nepotism&gt;ˈnɛpətɪz(ə)m&gt;noun&gt;the practice among those with power or influence of favouring relatives or friends, especially by giving them jobs.(Taken from google)So a few reasons why gamergaters supporting Jennie and her website is not nepotism:a), Most have no personal relationship to her, and promoting the content of someone you are a fan of is not nepotism., I am a big fan of Edmund McMillen, but me telling you to buy The Binding of Isaac is not nepotism because I am not his personal friend.b) Most supporters of gamergate are not in a position of power nor are they giving that power to Jennie by promoting her, website.c) If anyone in any kind of position of power or influencing WAS promoting Jennie's website and they properly disclosed their personal connection, they would not be violating the ethics that gamergate has been asking people to adhere to (see point 3.)This isn't really strictly gamergate related, or particularly important as the criticisms I'm replying to aren't that widespread or anything right now, but just in case this kind of thing gets picked up by gamergate detractors in a similar way I figured I may as well right this mostly because the criticisms were bugging me because they are pretty much entirely baseless., Sorry if this got really long, I have a habit of that.]\n",

      "[I don't know about anyone else, but I am thoroughly disappointed with some of the challenges put into Rebirth, especially considering unlocks are locked behind each one so if you're a completionist like myself, you're forced to try to deal with them if you actually want to be able to complete the game., The main offenders from what I've played so far are (and I've not played all of them):**Solar System****Suicide Kings****Cat Got Your Tongue****Beans**All of these challenges except Suicide King share the common theme that you cannot shoot tears at all, full stop., Instead you're supposed to complete rooms in a variety of ways using different items instead., It sounds like an interesting concept, but how any of these challenges made it through testing I will never know., In **Solar System** you start with no ability to fire tears, and instead have a Halo of Flies, Distant Admiration and Forever Alone as your only way of dealing damage., There are no item rooms, so you're only hope of salvaging this hopeless run is through boss items or deals with the devil., By default, you're expected to kill enemies with the orbital flies alone, a feat which is almost certain to cause you to take damage against most of the enemy types in the game., You are, at least, given the ability to fly so that otherwise impossible rooms are slightly more possible., You're expected to take this challenge all the way to Mom's Heart, a boss fight which I imagine to be utterly impossible with the default starting items as there is no way you have the crowd control necessary, let alone the ability to damage the heart without taking constant damage from its attacks.**Cat Got Your Tongue** is a similar story, and in this you start as Guppy but again you cannot fire tears and so have no way to generate any flies besides Guppy's Head, which you start with., You also start with Guppy's Hairball, a fairly useless item that ranks even lower than the orbital flies as a means to do any reliable damage to an enemy without getting yourself hurt., I was extremely fortunate enough to get Steven as my first boss on this challenge, and as a result of getting Little Steve I was able to generate flies from his attacks., Later on the run I got Bob's Brain which also allowed me to actually damage enemies with reasonable consistency and with a reasonable lack of risk to myself, and was able to barely beat Mom's Heart as a result of this perfect storm of items., I would imagine if I had not gotten this combo, I would have found the challenge incompletable until I got a run lucky enough to get some kind of familiar + bob's brain., I would imagine this item combo might make the Solar System challenge completable as well, with the added problem of you need to become guppy first in that challenge too, further adding to the incredible luck in item spawns you need to achieve it, further complicated by the fact that devil rooms are inherently hard to come by in a challenge where not taking damage is next to impossible.**Suicide Kings*, * is a bizarre idea for a challenge in that you start with the infamous Ipecac + My Reflection combo, which if you played the original Isaac, if you ever took this combo before you were aware of it, you basically had to end your run., Inexplicably you're expected to take this challenge all the way to Isaac in the Cathedral, a boss fight which I am fairly adamant is literally impossible to complete if actually using Ipecac/My Reflection to do so., As a result, the only way to beat this challenge is to get either Brimstone or Mom's Knife in order to counter the effect of My Reflection and stop killing yourself from self-inflicted damage., This is again inherently difficult to do as getting devil rooms is very difficult as you are so prone to taking damage., I will say its the most reasonable of the 4 challenges I list (which isn't saying a lot), as after some practice I was able to learn how to use Ipecac with My Reflection to some degree of reliability, by realising I effectively had to act as if I had very low range., I could shoot enemies just outside of the radius to avoid taking self-inflicted damage to kill them., After about a dozen or so runs that mostly ended in the basement, I was extremely lucky to get Brimstone as a drop from the Fallen on Caves 2 after being about 1 or 2 hits away from death, and after getting Brimstone the run was fairly trivial (I also got very lucky on obtaining health-generating items from then on to recover from my health deficit.)**Beans!, ** is by far the worst offender of all these challenges., In this challenge you once again cannot fire tears, and start with The Bean, a once-per-room poison effect in a small radius, which is actually self-charging due to you starting with the 9-volt, albeit at a tedious speed., You also start with Pyro (99 bombs) and butt bombs, which make your bombs damage all enemies in the room for a small amount and daze them, causing them to briefly stop attacking and wander about randomly., This challenge does not seem to have been tested at all, as the damage from The Bean is so low that it won't kill most enemies past the basement without poisoning them twice., This means you have to use the item once, then waiting approximately 15 seconds for the items to recharge itself., If waiting seems tedious (and believe me it is) then your only other offensive measure with your starting load-out is to bomb enemies., Needless to say, there are many rooms where bombs are either ineffective, or simply cannot reach some enemy types in certain room layouts., Butt bombs offsets this slightly, but once you reach the caves and beyond enemies have enough health such that it is very inefficient to use multiple bombs in order to kill them with the splash damage., On my run, I replaced The Bean with Guppy's Head as it is a similar once-per-room item made self-charging from the 9-Volt, but more effective - providing you can land the tears - as the tears are quite powerful., Nevertheless, several rooms and bosses against which bombs were ineffective meant that by the Depths-1, I was completely dry on bombs and left with no actual means to damage enemies in a room except using Tammy's Head once every 15 seconds., As you can imagine, I was dead within a couple of rooms of the start of this floor, with no hope of ever reaching the Mom fight where this challenge hopefully ends., The only way I could see this maybe being possible would be to get extremely lucky and obtain both Brimstone and Tammy's Head., You wouldn't be able to fire the brimstone normally but usually one shot of the omni-directional Brimstone blast of Tammy's Head is enough to clear most rooms., At worst, you'd probably have to wait 15 seconds and use Tammy's Head a second time., As it stand though, by default with this challenge you'll probably be completing a lot of rooms by waiting out the 60 second period until the doors unlock themselves and allow you to skip the room., The common theme (and problem) with all of these challenges is that, with the starting load-out, it is not reasonably possible to actually complete the challenge., And, since your tears are disabled (except in Suicide Kings), the only way to complete these challenges are to obtain items which defeat the theme and the purpose of the challenge to begin with., I don't feel skilled by beating Suicide Kings by getting Brimstone, for example, because its a cheese-strat., But its about the only strategy that is feasible., These challenges certainly aren't challenging, unless you count luck in getting the right items to offset them, and they certainly aren't gun., Moreover, the fact that in a lot of these challenges you're left waiting for the 60-second period for the doors to unlock is symptomatic of a big problem in Rebirth in general; that certain item combinations can leave some rooms either extremely difficult or downright impossible, usually due to a combination of low-range, large rooms, and stationary enemies., The fact that a mechanic like the doors unlocking to allow you skip a room that you cannot complete is frankly a work-around to a problem that never should have existed in the first place, and that disappoints me a little as the original Isaac never had these problems despite all its glitches and issues with Flash as a platform., Don't get me wrong, I still love Rebirth to death and I think overall it is a vast improvement on the original, but there are a few nagging issues which surprise me greatly for an Edmund McMillen game, as he always struck me as one of those game designers that always thinks of every little detail., The problems are certainly exaggerated by the presence of these unbalanced challenges, many of which baffle me as to how they came into existence in the first place., How anyone working on Rebirth ever expected a challenge in which you cannot ever fire a single tear to be

      "[I am a bit confused by this whole thing., I understand that heroes being added to captain's mode in the middle of a tournament is disruptive to player's strategies, and I would totally understand if a decision was made by dreamleague admins to say ignore the heroes, but an agreement made privately between specific teams seems unfair and I do not understand why this sort of behaviour would be allowed in the tournament?Which teams are making these agreements?, Are all teams on even footing here when making such agreements or does it only happen between teams friendly to one another?, If it is acceptable for teams to agree with one another to ignore Brood and Phoenix, would it also be acceptable for them to decide to ignore other heroes?, What about Terrorblade or Naga Siren?, Could they agree to ignore other aspects of the game, certain items or specific hero combinations?It seems unfair to the viewers who want to see players battle it out with everything available in the game, and choosing to ignore Brood and Phoenix can change the game quite a lot., Captain's mode's ban and pick phase is designed to allow players to control heroes that they don't want to see, but choosing to ignore heroes and not pick OR ban them, means that both teams basically have 7 bans instead of 5.Even if teams were banning brood and/or phoenix in every game it would change the outcome because other heroes would potentially get through as a result., I realise, this would be very hard to police, because there is no way to tell if two teams have a secret agreement to ignore a certain hero, or if both teams just decided to ignore them on their own with no collusion., I realise the players have little-to-no experience with these heroes and as a result may not want to touch them, but the openness with which the idea of a \"gentleman's agreement\" is being talked about by the casters leaves me concerned that this kind of collusion is a commonly accepted occurrence during tournaments like these., Maybe I am alone in this, but personally I feel somewhat cheated as a viewer if teams are talking privately to ignore certain heroes and therefore not having to either pick nor ban them during the draft, and affecting the outcome of the draft as a result., If there are currently no rules against this and this sort of behaviour is not policed in any way, I would really hope to see the Dreamleague admins take a stance on this and, where appropriate, take action.]\n",

WWE un-enjoyable for me., They MUST stop being paranoid about concussions, or other injuries in general., We all know what happened with Benoit was a tragedy, but for fuck sake the guy took so many unprotected headshots from chairs, did diving headbutts for years, and there are loads of clips out there of him botching shit and landing on his head., That was NOT a typical case for a superstar., They may be getting sued regarding concussions but frankly if you get into a business like wrestling how the fuck you don't expect to suffer concussions is fucking beyond me., Now I'm not a lawyer, clearly, but banning any and all moves that make the opponent even *appear* to land on their head, ... doesn't that admit some kind of guilt in making your guys take \"unsafe\" moves for years, before?What's more, what is the deal with the **complete** ban on these moves?, What the fuck is wrong with steel chair headshots where the guy just puts up his hands to block the shot?, It's like HHH's sledgehammer shot where you can clearly see, he puts his hand over the hammer to stop any *real* impact but it still looks good aesthetically., There certainly are some moves that are probably too unsafe to do, or at least regularly, but you cannot ban all moves that have the opponent land somewhat on their head., What next, do we ban DDT's?Fact is you don't have to land *on* your head to get a concussion., You could get a concussion from a powerbomb, with the whiplash your head can take, or from basically any fall., Are we gonna ban all powerbombs, top-rop moves, or basically any move?Is there even a single documented case of a move like the curb stomp ever hurting anybody?, It's one thing to ban a move that has a history of hurting people, but to ban any move that *looks good* but hasn't actually hurt anybody is rediculous., The truth is, selling moves by landing on your head or neck-area looks fucking good., It looks brutal, it can make you wince sometimes., Is it dangerous?, Sure, but didn't a guy just fucking **die** from taking a dropkick?Wrestling is a dangerous fucking business, get used to it., Fact is, if you take away all brutal looking offence to the point where no one ever takes a move that looks even remotely unsafe, how the fuck am I ever supposed to maintain a semblance of kayfabe?, How am I ever supposed to believe that two guys who really want to beat the fucking hell out of each other will carefully and gently make sure their opponent never quite lands *too hard.*Look at NXT for fuck sake, how many guys have a basic strike move as their finisher?, Spinning wheel kicks, big boots in the corner, running one-leg dropkicks, double footstomp from the rope., And why do guys have moves like this?, Well, just how many moves *are* there that small guys can do to big guys that doesn't require them to land \"unsafe., \", These guys *have* to do shitty strike moves as finishers because their's nothing left., And what happens, when all these small indie guys you're bringing up, have all the interesting looking striking moves as finishers?, Well, no one else can use them that's what., So not only will finishing moves look weak as hell, but regular movesets will only become more and more and more dull and repetitive and uninteresting., Hey, here's a novel idea., How about you employ *wrestlers* who are talented, trained, and can take brutal looking moves safely?, How about you stop employing guys just because they *look good* and employ guys because they *are good*?, Because I'm pretty sure there are people in this world

fucking job to figure out how to deliver that while also keeping their guys safe., If the only way you can keep your guys safe is to start banning a ton of wrestling moves then guess what?, You shouldn't be in the wrestling business., If you unbanned every single move that WWE has ever banned right now, their entire set of moves would still look a ton safer than most of the stuff I see posted here daily from NJPW or ROH or LU or random indies., I've quit watching WWE before, and I only just got back into it recently., I'm actually quite enjoying it and like most of the guys on their

They lost., * I hadn't been following EGs run that closely as there were several other teams that I liked a lot, but they were the only team that I would call myself a fan of that stayed in the upper bracket, so I was hopeful they might topple CDEC and make it into the Grand Finals., They, of course, lost., * Back down in the lower bracket after Vici Gaming have eliminated two teams, VP and MVP Phoenix, that I had started to support after losing most of my favorite teams, I decided that I do still really like the Vici Squad even if I am still sad that Black is no longer on the team., Vici are undefeated in the LB however, while CDEC are undefeated in the Upper Bracket, meaning that if EG didn't make it back to the finals, like I want I could at least be hype for two undefeated teams facing off in the Grand Finals., Vici, Gaming promptly oblige by losing to LGD.All in all, silly as it might sound, this has made it extremely challenging for me to actually enjoy this years International, despite the extreme quality of the Dota that has been played., I can only presume from here on that EG will now lose to LGD in the LB finals, setting up CDEC vs EHOME for the Grand Finals., I have grown a little fond of CDEC simply because their play has been so amazing, even though I neither know nor particularly care for any of the individual players., Presumably this means that LGD are set to win the Grand Finals so congrats in advance to them I guess., No doubt some people will read this and just see it as a shitpost, but I really wanted to get this off my chest., I am cursed to never see the teams I root for win in TI.]\n",

Like an onion., And an ogre.&gt;So how does it work?, Let's say I want to access the website that's located at this server., My computer connects to another computer in the Tor network, which connects to another, and so on., Eventually, one of them will connect to the server, which can send back information using this pattern., However, none of the computers in the Tor network know who is getting what., The computer that you connect to isn't the same as the one that connected to the server, so it's very anonymous.&gt;Another key feature is that the path of nodes used differs each time., The first time I visit a site, it might connect to computer B, then computer A, then computer J before connecting to the server., The next time, it might connect to computer F, then computer B, then computer L before getting the server., As a result, not only do none of the computers know who is viewing what, but the computers used change from time to time (, about every ten minutes).&gt;So why use Tor and onion routing?, Simply because it's very, very anonymous., All the connections are encrypted and it would be nearly impossible to trace a user., It is, however, much slower than regular browsing, since we have to connect to all these computers in series., More on how Tor works [here](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en).&gt;As for the deep web, that's mostly unrelated., The deep web refers to sites that aren't accessible via search engines., Since you couldn't find it via, say, Google normally, the site is as good as hidden from the eyes of normal people., This could mean that it's simply not linked to., Search engines follow links., If nothing links to a site, it as good as doesn't exist., There's also sites that instruct search engines specifically to not index them., Search engines have to follow a text file called \"robots.txt\", which tells what can and can't be indexed.&gt;However, much of the deep web is perfectly safe., Things like your facebook page might be hidden from search engines if you're underage or specified you didn't want it indexed., Likewise, most websites have deep web sections that are meant for administration, and thus not accessible by regular users., The dangerous part of the deep web, particularly child pornography, makes up an extreme minority., The term sounds worse than it is., However, there is, of course, a very dangerous minority., Several examples are mentioned in [this article](http://www.businessinsider.com/tor-silk-road-deep-web-2013-3)., These sites use Tor as a [hidden service](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en), meaning they are a server connected to a Tor network, allowing them the same anonymity., Instead of hiding a user, the Tor network is now hiding a server.&gt;###So in summation&gt;, * **Onion routing**: Using multiple computers to create a chain before accessing the desired server., As a result, no individual computer knows who you are and what you want., This makes it great for anonymity., * **Tor**: A project that created a network of computers for use as nodes in onion routing., Anyone can set up their computer to become a Tor node., * **Deep web**: The part of the web that can't be found by search engines., Mostly harmless, but there is a minority with sites ranging from contract hitmen to child pornography., The malicious sites sometimes use Tor networks to hide their server location.&gt;---&gt;###Using Tor&gt;I'd actually recommend everyone download the Tor browser., For the most part, the average person would rarely need the program, and you definitely don't want to browse with Tor normally., It's slow, slow, slow., However, if you *ever* need anonymity for some reason, the Tor browser is secure and easy to use., Just download this program and open the executable., That's it., There's nothing to configure., It's just a modified Firefox browser., You can download it for all the major operating systems [here](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en).&gt;So what's different about the browser besides the fact it uses Tor?, Well, there's three specific addons installed., NoScript (which allows you to disable JavaScript), TorButton (which just does some security improvements and makes it easy to change your identity), and HTTPS Everywhere (which makes the browser use secure connections when available and you should actually use this on every browser)., They recommend you don't add any other addons, but I say go ahead and throw adblock into the mix, especially since ads slow you down on what is already a slow connection.&gt;Anyway, you should note that you shouldn't open files you download on Tor unless you're certain they're safe., This is because if the file makes a connection to the internet, it will do so through a regular connection, thus revealing your real IP., For most files, it's perfectly safe, such as opening a regular JPG file, but still tread cautiously.&gt;Need even MORE security?, In steps [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)., It's a Debian-based linux operating system that connects solely to the Tor network., You can run it entirely on a USB stick without installing anything., Keep it on a flash drive and boot that when using a computer you don't trust., Not only are you protected from things like keyloggers on the computer, but your internet browsing it unknown to others., Tails is specifically geared towards anonymity, so it doesn't even use the hard drives for temporary storage., It also encrypts the files that you may store on the flash drive, so no worries about someone else looking at your stuff.&gt;Finally, on the mobile front is [Orbot](https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/), a Tor browser for Android., Unfortunately, iOS users don't have an alternative., They could use [TorVPN](http://torvpn.com/information.html) as just a standard VPN server, although it's not free, and let's be honest, you could just get a regular VPN server that would be much faster and usable for things like downloading torrents., There's the [Covert browser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/covert-browser/id477438328?mt=8), but it's also not free and seems poorly rated.&gt;I suppose, of course, it's worth a mention of VPN. VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a server that we connect to as an inbetween, like Tor nodes do., So we connect to that VPN in an encrypted connection and that VPN connects to the desired server., So it works like Tor, but isn't layered., They're still very secure, however you'd generally pay for it., It's easier to set up your connections to all use that VPN, however., One particular advantage of a VPN is that you could access content as though you were browsing from the location of the server., For example, I'm Canadian, so I can't normally get Hulu., If I use an American VPN, I can access Hulu because as far as Hulu can tell, I'm just a computer in the US.&gt;However, not all VPNs are anonymous., TorrentFreak made a nice [list](http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/) of VPN providers that don't keep information on you.&gt;While you'd have to pay to use an anonymous VPN, it'd be faster than Tor, could be used to make it appear you're in a specific country, and can be applied to all connections., To elaborate on the last point, your connection would use the VPN when doing something like using uTorrent., You're not just limited to the Tor Browser., There's still a latency issue, since you have to connect to this inbetween, but it's much faster than Tor, since there's only one node between you and the desired server and the VPN usually has very fast speeds compared to Tor nodes.&gt;**So to sum that part up, Tor is great because it's free and easy, not to mention sites can use it to stay hidden., When you need more versatile anonymity, a VPN comes in handy.**http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/19twt9/eli5_the_deep_web_onion_routing_and_tor/c8ramv7]\n",

      "[I've doing doing a lot of research lately about how Islam is beginning to be a considerable problem in Western Europe, and I've been wondering about what your feelings are on banning the niqab and burqa., On one hand, I don't think the state should have the power to restrict how we want to express ourselves, but I can sort of understand where these guys are coming from though.  , I'm pretty sure these are the reasons why someone would make an argument for banning the burqa and niqab in Europe:* It's a possible security risk that could guarantee any group of people anonymity.  , (Like wearing ski masks)* It's a clear sign of refusal to assimilate into Western society*, It's a visible sign of oppression.  , Nobody honestly buys that the women who wear them actually had a real choice about it, they were brainwashed their whole life*, It discourages radical Muslims to immigrate to your countryHere are my thoughts on the ban itself: The French notion of civil rights is rather different than the American notion of it., It's not something that can be easily generalized in a few sentences, but I'll try - we Americans are very idealistic about rights., We think of them as absolute; if there is a Right to X it applies to EVERYONE no matter what and damn the consequences., The French, by contrast, are very utilitarian., To them, rights are about The Greatest Good for the Greatest Number., They perceive radical Islam as a threat to society as a whole, so to their way of thinking, curtailing it just a bit protects the rights of the vast majority of people who aren't Muslim while not trampling the rights of the vast majority of their Muslim population., In short, I support the Europeans for banning these items because of it helps enforce their cultural identity and sends a message to radical Muslims that they are not welcome in European liberal democracies.]\n",

      "[Recently I’ve taken an interest in BJJ., Since I was a young kid I have always enjoyed martial arts (I’m 19 now)., I took many years of TKD and by the end of it I achieved a 2nd degree black belt., After that it began to bore me so I left to play sports in middle school and some of high school., I feel like going back to martial arts would be a good thing for me since right now I don’t do much of anything., I looked into some schools in my area, which is Buffalo(NY), and the best one around is one that is close to 20 miles away., The head instructor of the academy is Charles Anzalone, who trained under Grand Master Carlson Gracie Sr, which I thought was really awesome., There are some schools that are a little closer, but I don’t think it would classify as BJJ., My concern is pretty much the driving., Driving 20mi multiple times a week might become a burden since I only have so much money and with college., You guys think this is just a matter of if I really want to do this and this is just an excuse I’m telling myself?, I would appreciate your thoughts on if you guys value experience versus comfortably?Thanks!]\n",

      "[Hello Team Korea!I'm another late starter, having subscribed to the subreddits before the challenge began, and then forgetting until a post here on Team Korea floated onto the front page., A little about me, I'm just a dude from Australia, who one day hopes to travel to Korea to teach English, as many do., I'm intrigued by not only the language, but the people, culture and history, and, I can easily see myself falling in love with the country the moment I set foot on it's shores.**Background:, ** Although I've been exposing myself to Korean for the last year or so, I wouldn't say I've really studied the language., I've picked up a few bits and pieces passively from watching variety show or listening to music, but not nearly enough to say I have any proficiency beyond saying hello and then the inevitable fumble as I prove I know, nothing much else., Since November last year, I finally got fed up with having hopes and dreams of learning the language that weren't going anywhere, so I put my head down and started to work for it., It's been slow going, but since the beginning of the year I've been picking up pace, and I hope to see that continue to snowball until the end of the year.**Resources:***, Anki - I have Anki currently installed on my tablet, which rarely ever leaves my side., My deck currently has 402 cards, which are both forward and reverse versions of cards found on Memrise., I've been forcing myself to learn the words both ways as I find words stick with me longer if I learn to write them in both languages., * Memrise - I'm currently going through the TOPIK Vocabulary deck on Memrise, which is where I'm gaining my vocabulary words for my Anki deck., * TTMIK/HaruKorean - I'm combining both the use of the TTMIK podcasts and associated PDF's, with their HaruKorean site, which a membership site where you are able to practice the things you've learned in each lesson of the podcast, and have a native speaker correct it for you., I'm finding the ability to ask questions as to why something I wrote was wrong to be invaluable., *, YouTube - There are so many great YouTube channels out there, and the resources thread covers all of those that I use., * Tumblr - I've stumbled across a few interesting Tumblr accounts which share various Korean language points, such as vocab, grammar and more., I'll dig them out if people are interested., It's not the most obvious place to find resources, but there's at least a little bit there.**Method:*, *, Every day I work, I end up spending anywhere up to three hours total on public transport, so it's as easy as plugging in some earphones and getting some study in., Currently my time consists of watering any wilting plants on Memrise, and planing new seeds as I go., I try for around 15 a day, as I've found that to be about as much as wants to stick with me at any one time., Afterwards, I proceed through my Anki deck and go through any reviews I need to do there, while also adding in any new vocab words I've picked up through Memrise., Next, I'll go through a TTMIK/HaruKorean lesson, and try my hand at making a sentence using any grammar or vocabulary the lesson teaches., I'll ask any questions regarding corrections of my sentences., If I have time afterwards, I might fill that up with looking through Tumblr, or on the various language reddits.**Goals:, ** As mentioned at the beginning, the ultimate dream would be to bring my proficiency to a point where I could travel to Korea and be able to engage the people I meet beyond simple introductions and asking for directions., I'd love my interest or proficiency in Korean to help me meet new and interesting people, here on reddit, the internet in general, and of course, out and about in the real world., With the goal of traveling to Korea to teach English, I would like to use Korean to help supplement my ability to teach., Not necessarily to use with my students, but if anything, to better understand their needs., I also think it would be encouraging for my students to see myself struggle with learning Korean, just as they may while learning English.---That's about all I really have to say for the moment, except thanks for having me, and that I'm excited to join in on the challenge, and look forward to talking with you all., I'll see you in a week with my first update!]\n",

      "[I say beginning as it's the start of my Total Language journey, but not the beginning of my journey into learning the Korean language.**This Week:** I haven't really changed my study pattern or done anything different than I usually do., Every day I've done my typical review of my Anki cards, then a review of my Memrise cards (which is where I get my Anki cards currently)., After that I go through one block of new vocab on Memrise (typically 15 words).I'm a little disappointed as I had a friends birthday party get together at the zoo, and as a result, I missed my daily flashcards., I could have spared some time in the evening, but I was a little too lazy (that, and Game of Thrones is too addictive..., )All in all, my Anki deck now sits on 522 cards (technically 261, each card is duplicated with Korean-English and English-Korean to help reading/retention)., Going forward, I'm considering bumping up my new words to two blocks of 15 in the hope to gain a larger vocab that I can utilise.**Grammar:, ** Grammar is something I've been skipping entirely, most likely to my detriment., I've had a feeling that I would be more comfortable learning grammar points when I had words to interchange in with the examples given, especially as I've found a lot of examples stick with the same words - water, apple, to go., My HaruKorean subscription renewed automatically, and served as a reminder that I should probably get back into those lessons soon.**Victories:, ** I work in a supermarket, and I've always kept my ears open for Korean customers speaking to each-other., Finally my knowledge was of use, as an older Korean woman approached me asking where something was., She was saying \"choko\" and making a drinking motion towards her mouth., I wasn't sure what she wanted, and it must have shown, as she started speaking in Korean to herself., She said 우유, and my first thought was \"shit, I know that word., Milk!\" and happily pointed her in the right direction., Whether she noticed I understood her Korean, or if she simply thought I'd finally worked out what she was trying to convey, I don't know, but I was very happy to have understood., It might be a simple little thing, but it's my first, and gives me hope., Perhaps I'll gain enough courage to speak in Korean with other customers as they pass through my register during the day.**Resources:*, *, I mentioned in my introduction that I'd found a couple of Korean-learning tumblr accounts, and I'll drop the links here now, , Perhaps they can be added to the resources thread?, Only a couple were typically active, so I only have a few links.[Let's Korean](http://ceilingofstars.tumblr.com/)[Infinite Hangul](http://infinitehangul.tumblr.com/)[Talk to me in Korean](http://talktomeinkorean.tumblr.com/)As an aside, I'm also thinking of supplementing my vocab by using example sentences., When I say that I mean more natural sentences than you find in language lessons., I haven't found any yet, but are there any good resources where I can get simple, beginner-type sentences to use and make flashcards out of?, I think this will be the next logical step for learning the language.**Next Week:**, In the coming week, I think I'm going to try to learn more vocabulary than I have previously been, as well as actually progressing in grammar lessons via TTMIK/HaruKorean., If I have time to spare, I'll do a more thorough search to find example sentences to use, from the web and other places., Whoo, that was a bit longer than I anticipated., Anyway, I look forward to seeing where we all are a week from now!, Keep rocking!]\n",

point, I wasn’t having any real contractions and, in a normal, no complications pregnancy, I would just be sent home until something started., Unfortunately for me, I had Gestational Diabetes and the fluid levels around my baby were measuring very low, so they were going to admit me and get me started on oxytocin., My mom arrived at the hospital around 3:30am., Nothing was happening., There was no progress., I walked around a bit, drank a ton of water and watched Con Air., Then I got checked., There was no progress., According to the monitor, I was experiencing some fairly strong contractions, but I couldn’t feel anything., So they upped the Oxytocin., a few times., Then there was pain., As per my birth plan, we started small for pain., Hot packs, aromatherapy, essential oils., We walked around a lot so I could breathe., The pain, unfortunately, began to extend from my stomach/abdomen around to my back., It was very stabby, so I requested laughing gas., The laughing gas was helpful in that I had to focus on breathing., It didn’t really dull the pain but it was an excellent distraction from the contractions., My husband sat behind me while I laboured for a while and my mom alternated between holding my hand, giving me water and making silly jokes to keep my mind occupied., Over the next few hours, I worked through the pain in a number of different ways., I took a shower (awesome), my husband and I said a number of prayers, we went for a few more walks, , I swayed my hips and made low “, ahhhh” noises through the pain., I was fading fast and needed more help so I went for fentanyl., I was told I could take another dose every 15-20 minutes but I tried to space it out more, to about every 30., It was hard but I managed for another couple of hours like this., I sat on my hospital bed, hugged my husband, breathed more laughing gas, screamed, cried, crushed my husbands hand, drank some water and checked the time after every couple contractions., It had been 22 hours since I got to the hospital., I had been awake for 34 straight hours., The OB came in and checked me., I was only 2-3 cm dilated., After 22 hours, I was only 2 cm dilated., The doctor left and I had to seriously consider the progression of labor., I wasn’t dilating., After 22 hours of pain and back labor, I hadn’t progressed at all., I couldn't think., I couldn't move., I could barely breathe., Contractions were lasting about a minute and were hitting every minute and a half to 2 minutes., I screamed through the pain and had to be reminded to take deep breaths., Finally, I couldn’t take it and asked for an epidural., I’m still trying to deal with that., Moving on., The epidural was awesome., I will freely admit that., I couldn’t feel anything which meant I got to take a nap., I also got to relax with my husband and watch a movie., From there, things moved quickly., The next few hours flew by., The OB came in and I was 4-5 centimetres and fully effaced., Finally., By this time It was about 3:00am, and I had been awake for about 42 hours, with a couple intermittent naps in between., Over the next hour and a half I progressed from 5 to 9 centimetres, after which the nurses propped one of my legs up to give the baby more space., At 5:30am, I felt the urge to push., It was a strange feeling because I couldn’t feel the contraction but I felt an immense pressure that felt like I was very constipated., So I started pushing., I pushed for 2 hours only to be told that baby is sunny side up., She was head down but facing my stomach instead of my tail bone., It took 2 separate doctors to turn her and then I was told that I have one hour to get her out, after which they would start prepping me for a c-section., Pushing suddenly became easier., My baby was coming fast., The doctor came in to deliver and has the NICU team standing by (“Just in case,\" I’m told)., So I kept pushing., Suddenly everything got hectic., I could hear people saying, “, It broke,\" “Snapped,\" “Code blue,\" “Baby blue?”, , “how long?, ” and I’m suddenly surrounded by about 10 more people, most of whom I don't know., Everyone was talking over each other., I was still pushing and suddenly terrified., My baby came out surrounded by a flurry of activity at 7:16am on June 10, 2015., The NICU team took her over to the warmer immediately and placed an oxygen mask over her face., When they took it off, she gurgled and cooed and screamed a little., I cried., My husband cried., My mom cried., Everyone congratulated me and I finally got skin on skin time., Shortly thereafter, I’m told that her umbilical cord broke., It had been wrapped around her neck and when the doctor flipped it over her head, it broke., My little girl was without oxygenated blood for 1 minute and 16 seconds., Luckily, there wasn’t any lasting effects., She is beautiful and perfect., If you’ve made it this far, congratulations., I hope my ramblings made sense., I needed it all written out., For me, you

slides his front, his feet “, stick” to the board as he jumps over a set of six stairs, also having to jump over to the other side of the hand rail in the middle of said set., CRASH!, The skater clears the stairs and landed on his board, but his balance is wobbly at best., This causes his wheels to scrape up against the bottom of his board, and throws the husky, average sized teenager off of it.  , He does a forward roll, and a half as his hands slap the ground to break his fall., “Fucking wheel bite!”, He says., “You alright Twon, you had that ollie over the rail?!?, ”, Asks another teen who is filming the incident. “I’m over it” exclaims Twon, better known as Tweezy to those who know him., “, You’re fucking close dude!”, Blaze, the filmer says in protest., “I got other shit to do man fuck wasting my time on this shit, my trucks are shit they keep giving me the wobbles., ”, Tweezy dusts himself off, and checks his pockets to make sure he has something, he puts on a backpack, and checks his phone., “, Excuses, excuses, where you headed?, You gonna mess with those Bummerall cats huh mayne?, ”, Blaze asked referring to the neighborhood kids from across the town bridge., Twon jumped back on his board and flicked off his friend, as he rode away towards the Bummerall., He thought that nickname was stupid, and unnecessary but for the neighborhood, it worked., He put on his headphones and switched to playlist of  Lupe Fiasco’s “Kick,Push\", UGK, and Modest Mouse., Twon seemed as if in meditation while he cruised along the streets skating to the music , he also loved the freedom of skating as he started popping random ollies over cracks, and speed bumps., He thought about his next sale, a “dub sack” of brick weed, or about nine or ten grams of pot probably imported from somewhere in latin America, the pot is of low quality because it is well traveled and sold for quantity, hence the “bricks” of dried buds pressed together so they can fit in car engines, tires, who knows what else., Now he was at Bomerall and a few streets away from his destination, his speed slowed down significantly as the asphalt was rough, and he had to push his board for speed quite often now., He always thought the name Bomerall was stupid, then he remembered that Lance guy who had somehow conned his way into stealing Twons red and yellow Snodgrass “color changing pipe”, he was quite pissed about that since it was an authentic and all., Those kids were shady, he also remembered his friend, Jap J (his only fellow friend who was also a Asian/islander mix) who recently was murdered there minding his own business, walking to the neighborhood park to watch something stupid like a fight or something., Now Tweezy was a little more serious, and his eyes focused he found the shortcut to the park, and jumped the wooden fence into the back of the park., A tall kid wearing an even taller person’s shirt and oversized basketball shorts flagged him down, “, Right, chea Tweezy, Right chea!”Great, Tweezy thought, this guy., Bud was one of the “bumerall” kids, he usually didn’t have enough for a “dub sack”,, but it was a Friday, and he had somehow gotten an extra 5 from his pops, by telling his father that he had a “hot date., ”, Bud and Tweezy had PE together throughout middle school, and were just acquaintances now since its been a few years since they had a class together., Tweezy still considered them “cool”, but he did know that Bud hung out with all the shadier kids in the neighborhood, and was known for pulling some stunts from time to tme.“Let’s go right here Tweez, I got somethin’ for ya bitch azz “, Bud said in his most southern accent, he kept fidgeting around in his shorts., As he motioned for them to sit on some park, benches.“C’mon man quit fucking around, I got a trick, I had homeboy filming” now Tweez wished he as back trying to jump stairs, as he noticed Bud looked like he might be carrying something, maybe a .9 mm., Twon now wished he was carrying, but didn't think he needed to for a skate session, and to sell a $20 bag.“Damn man, hold up, gotta get my shit right”, Bud sounded annoyed., Twon started to remember the times he’s seen Bud pull moves on other people, and started watching him closely.“Damn mayne, what the hell these shorts ain’t coming through I gotta take this shit out right” Bud started fidgeting around, and Tweez saw some sort of metal flash and for some reason thought of his late friend Jap J, and how he wished he could just be skating and not selling a bag., Bud continued to fidget around making Twon nervous now he noticed that Bud was reaching deeper and had a certain glow in his eyes., Twon knew that this meant trouble, he gripped harder on his skateboard trucks., He saw that Bud was reaching deeper into his stash, and so he reacted., Two lifted his board and twisted his body as he brought it up., BAM!, He might have reacted too quickly and instead of swinging the board into Bud’s hands it hit his fellow schoolmate in the side of the head., Bud spun, and fell off the bench towards the ground with his arms spread eagle, blood already coming from his temple, flying across the air., Twon looked down sweating, breathing heavily, and with his heart bumping like the bass at a rap show., In Bud’s hands was his coveted Snod grass pipe, and a $20….]\n",

      "[A quote from a lecture I once had that explains what a immediate effects of nuclear blast are:\"A nuclear explosion creates a large fireball within which everything is vaporized., The fireball rises rapidly, incorporating soil or water, then expands as it cools and loses buoyancy., The radioactive debris and soil that are initially swept upwards by the explosion are then dispersed in the directions of the prevailing winds., Fallout consists of microscopic particles that are deposited on the ground.\"1., The first point to be made is to Kyle - Nuclear fallout does involve contamination of the ground and vegitation., Infact the main exposure route is not inhilation or contact, but is plant absorbing the radioactictive particulates and then being consumed at much later times leading to major health concerns., It is important to keep in mind, the radioactive materials have huge half-lives, and you don't need to ingest much to cause irreparable harm.2., Secondly, Kyle is correct, Nuclear weapons are typically detonated at about 3~5Km to produce minimal fallout, at least that was the case in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.3., Nuclear fallout varies greatly depending on the local meteorological effects., e.g. places of great rainfall will wash away harmful material much faster than dry areas., However, the effects last anywhere from 10~30years for major products to decay to safe enough level to consider rehabitation (e.g. caesium-137, a major byproduct, has a half life, ~30 years)4., The major problem with nuclear explosions is the hug amounts of particulates they release into the atmosphere., These particulates cause gloabl dimming and potentially a Nuclear winter., This is the phenomenon of aerosols in the atmosphere blocking the sun's direct irradiance of the earth surface., This in turn lowers the temperature and messes with the hydrological cycle., Think of it as a counter-effect to greenhouse gasses causing global warming., Causing this effect on a reasonable scale messes greatly with food production and regional climates, and on large scale can potentially wipe out the human race (similar effects are thought to have killed the dinosaurs :(., It would only take about 0.5% of the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons to lower the global avg., temperature by 1.3C, enough to probably wipe out a large chunk of humanity., There are other effects, but I am not expert on nuclear weaponry or meteorology., My knowledge, however, comes from a master's degree in Physics and personal research.]\n",

      "[On this week TAC they talked about dragon pali, and how it wasn't \"working\" for them., Which i found odd, as mine done nothing but win on ladder so far(I'm rank 17 atm, so i'm not THAT far on ladder yet this month)., I'm not sure if it's because i'm low on ladder, my build, my play style, or luck., So i though i'd share my list and reasons for cards., (as well as some change options)http://s15.postimg.org/d78j5kdd7/Dergen_Pail.jpgI've only lost to 2 face hunters(never seamed to drew my early game/tech) and 2 druids(combo 1 game, other game just ran out of steam) on ladder so far(out of 14 games so far)., The Deck---------2x Zombie chow-, It's early game and anti aggo., Mmmmm, chow2x Equality- A lot of people run a 1 of, but i always seam to need 2 of it to win the long game.2x, Shielded Minibot-, It's minibot1x Coghammer-, The most recent addition to the deck, it's be SUPER useful in most match ups., Adds more taunt, makes for good trades, it's a early weapon, and it's not a bad draw late game.1x Muster for Battle- running a 1 of this is the most painful thing in the world..., i REALLY want to bring it back up to 2, but all my tech took up spaces., I will be working on bringing the second one back in.2x Aldor Peacekeeper- I will never run a pali deck without a 2 of this card.2x Truesilver Champion- See above2x Consecratio- See above1x Defender of Argus-, The taunt has been great against aggro decks and burst combos., And the pump has also been nice sometimes, but it could be a sunfury instead, i guess.2x, Hungry Dragon- I have gotten SOME bad things summoned., And a lot of time it get killed via hard removal, but when it doesn't i does work at board control/beat down., So i guess i'm okay with this card, because it protects my late game from that hard removal and is big enough., 1x, Kezan Mystic-, The weakest card of the deck., I never draw it against hunters or mages, or when i do they didn't have secrets ever., It should help against face hunters who have explosive trap and against freeze mage or secret mage it should be good., But i've yet to have that happen.1x, Azure Drake-, It's a dragon, it draws me a card, and it sometimes helps my Consecrations., 2x, Blackwing Coruptor- LOVE this card., One of the main reasons i love dragon.deck., Neutral fire Elemental baby!, I've yet to have issues with triggering it except when i'm top decking.2x Dragon Consort-, The reason dragon pali is even a potential thing., The first game i ever played this deck with, I got a turn 6 Ysara(thanks to having the coin, i won the game).2x Sludge Belcher- I love this card., It's one of the best taunts in the game., I seem to almsot always auto add 2 in every deck i make(kind of like how many people auto add lotheb)1x, Dr. Boom- It's Dr. Balanced., He's so balanced., War Golem went and got some bomb like wisps., It was balanced., 1x Lay on Hands- While solemn vigil is a cheaper card draw, the fact that it also heals me, allowing me to stabilize sometimes, makes this more versatile in my book., 1x, Chromaggus-, This card is REALLY fun., I've gotten some really nutty doubles thanks to him so far., Some of the best doubles he's gotten me have been belchers(more taunt!), consecrations, trion(my foe was SUPER salty kappa), and equality., 1x, Trion Fordring-, It's a pali deck that goes to late game., I'm going to run Trion.1x Ysera-, What's there to say?, it's Ysera, this is a dragon deck., She's auto include., Cut from the deck-------------Lotheb, i'm in th ecamp of over ratted., He rarely seams to help me out except against combo decks., He's not terrible and COULD replace mystic., But less 5 drops is better in this deckBlackwing, Tech- I found that this card made me want to keep dragons in hand to get vale, even if they costs 5 or more mana., I found that the only dragon i could keep with it was hungry dragon, or MAYBE if i was going second and therefore the coin, one of the 5 cost dragonsBig Game Hunter- I found less and less bgh targets on low ladder., Will be put back in as i get higher on ladder., Emperor Tarrisan/Slyvanas Windrunner-, My late game was already stacked and i needed more early game and mid game., So the the 6 drops had to go., Volcanic Drake- I never seamed to get him to be as cheap as i wanted., I also needed to make room for other cards., Options., ----------Healbot- Might help with stabilizing more often against face hunterSenjin Shieldmaster- More taunt helps against hunter and burst damage that's not spell oriented., 2nd Muster for battle-, Because it feels almost wrong to not run it., Quater Master- I cut him because i had a fair amount of 5 drops in the deck., If i re added him i would 100% add a second muster., Mind Control Tech-, Might be useful against aggo decks and Dr. Boom., Annoy-a-Tron-Only just now thought that maybe this might help against face hunter, but that would be in., Other Legendaries-, The ones that i cut(loteb, emporor, sylvanas) are all good/great and could maybe be worked back in or replace a legend that you might be missing., Nefarian is option if you lack ysera, but he's not as good as her., Onyxia might be good, but that's literally the only dragon card i don't own, so i don't know if it's any help for the deck or not., I doubt Alexstraszais to much help, but i guess she can be heal, and if you ended up not doing much damage or your opponent healed a lot it's some damage., My play style is to treat the deck like a control deck 90% of the time, and midrange the other 10%., But that's just my play styleedit-

      "[Story goes as follows; joined MD Army National Guard at 18 and I thought that would help me figure out what I wanted to do with myself., They also payed for me to get my good enough diploma since I got kicked out of high school twice(for absences) in 12th grade., I kind of just gave up once my family was homeless and living with my mothers friends., Think the final straw was seeing  my younger brother in all Advanced Placement classes dropout in 10th grade., Even though I am older I kinda looked up to him in some regards., When I say my family I mean my mother and brother since We don't know our fathers., Mine, I saw his obituary about 4 months ago and finally saw a pic of him and my brother just had a deadbeat., Well Everything went kind of as planned with the military, then I got a 2-3 month notice pretty much right after boot camp that my unit was getting deployed to go to Iraq and I was pretty ready for it since I was a fresh out of basic training soldier., Well, even though I just learned everything I needed to know about being in the army from boot camp we still had to do a MOB process before we could go., This took a little over 3 months from June 2007-September 2007., Mobilization was the worst thing ever and it was for older soldiers IMO who have been drilling for years on end and didn't know the way we were actually fighting insurgency., It was the worst 3 months ever., Boot camp was even better then this even though I could eat whatever I wanted or occasionally sneak off base late at night to a hotel and be with my girlfriend., The only thing about MOB I liked was shooting the shit out of every gun I wanted since I was a gunner., They wanted me to be a driver but I had no license yet., Well deployment comes and goes., We got a shit draw of a job being a prison guard at Camp Bucca., When I was there it was the biggest prion in the world., We were supposed to be in country from September 07 to August 08 but the Maryland Governor pulled some strings and got us to come home in the beginning of March., We flew back in to Ft., Dix NJ and stayed there for about 5 days before we could actually come home., Those 5-6 days were the longest ever since all I wanted to do was get home to my family friends and Gf., About 3-4 days after being back in my house My gf breaks up with me stating she \"was in love with the idea of me\" and \"I needed time\"., At first I thought time?, We just had 9 months apart., A week later she was with her ex.  , I was fine at first but when that happened depression set in., Hearsay rumors of cheating while deployed and life went on, but it took awhile to finally get over her., Started getting Heavy into Wow, and it kinda took my mind off my deployment and the whole gf situation., So I got my license, and with all my deployment money I bought a car., Well that was a bad decision because I financed for a 5 year plan paying about $225/mo., and I put $8,000 down..., I impulse blew my whole back account from deployment between car, rent, car insurance and just fast food everyday., After I couldn't get a job for months I eventually got my car repossessed., About a month or two after this I got kicked out of my house., I rented with 3 other guys from one of there mothers., She got married and moved to another part of the state but still owed a mortgage., We were pretty much just paying it off for her., Well thankfully my own mother just got married at 38 for the first time and had a room for me., Moved back in with her in Dec 2008., I played, Wow and other games religiously like wake and bake but of the gaming variety for months upon months on end., I quit WoW last April after giving away all my gold for papa johns pizza and new game time cards., I quit to also start looking for my career since I couldn't stand seeing myself in the mirror., Last summer I passed the test to become a Corrections Officer with flying colors and I thought that this could be my chance., Well not having a car and driving an hour away everyday is not an option so I started looking into other things., I even thought I would just try to get a job at TGI Fridays or target or Wal-mart., Anything to make a lil money to buy a shitty car to eventually get a job., Well Ive put in numerous applications to Best Buy, Wal-Mart and other companies that would probably hire from 10-12 an hour., In all of these applications they ask you about being a veteran and I feel like this is why I'm not getting a job., It is either becuase of me being a Veteran or a long period of time not working., I have very little documentation of work since 2008 and even so working a week here or there is not good enough to be put on a resume or even called job history., Well that is my theory., I feel like its just so hard to get a job without a car., Its like with a car comes a job., Well my mother just went on disability because she has CHF and she just cant work anymore as an emt with that condition., But since she is gonna be on that I should be able to use her vehicle but its a beater., I have a security clearance but with debt there is no way I could get a decent job., Only joys I currently have in life are gaming with friends and my brother., I'm trying to help him with getting a youtube channel started up but its proving harder then once thought., If you're wondering what he does he makes websites,
